  paragraph1: "Fast-paced urban transformation is one of the main challenges in urban development affecting the availability of water for urban populations. Sleman — a neighborhood adjacent to Yogyakarta city — is one of the areas which has been experiencing a transformation from rural-urban to urban, particularly in some key sites such as Mlati, Depok, Ngaglik, and Godean."
  paragraph2: "Even though the main authority for surface water and groundwater management resides at the provincial and municipal levels, village governments have the authority to develop a community group or activities in managing its water sources. In Indonesia, the village law becomes a strategic entry point for village governments — as the lowest form of government bodies in the country — to govern their own water sources management and implement a Polycentric Water approach at a village level."
