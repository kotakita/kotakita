  paragraph1: "Kota Kita has partnered with the Banjarmasin City Government and the Network of Mayors for Inclusive Cities to promote accessibility and mobility to public facilities and services, to stimulate economic empowerment and open more employment opportunities, and to increase people’s awareness on disabilities issues in everyday life. Following the development of a disability-inclusive City Profile of Banjarmasin with UNESCO in 2018, we organized a focus group discussion (FGD) with relevant stakeholders in April 2019 to explore ideas and potential programs in building a disability-inclusive city. The event was attended by city government, academics, disabled people organizations (DPOs), civil society organizations (CSOs), and persons with disabilities."
