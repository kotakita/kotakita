  paragraph1: "Following the initial phases of the Women on Wheels Project in Indonesia – Feasibility Study, Toolbox Development and Program Design – Kota Kita has implemented a pilot project in Solo city. This pilot, completed in August 2018, consists of a multi-faceted set of actions with the primary purpose to promote cycling for girls and women in Solo. The pilot works with four key population groups and institutions from the city to facilitate and share skills to advocate and promote a pro-cycling agenda. Activities also include educating and raising awareness about the benefits of an alternative mode of transportation - convenience, health and environmental advantages. Kota Kita developed the activities based on context-based research and interactions with several stakeholders and population groups conducted in previous phases."
  paragraph2: "As with many other Indonesian cities, Solo is experiencing a rapidly increasing motorized urbanization, mainly through increased motorcycle ownership and ridership. Consequently, the city is experiencing increasing air pollution levels, road congestions, and higher rate of traffic accidents. Furthermore, the role of non-motorized transportation such as cycling in Solo has been largely neglected. Increased traffic and poor road maintenance has led to reduced comfort and the mobility of cyclists, many of who are women and girls in the case of Solo."
