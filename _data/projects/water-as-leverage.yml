  paragraph1: "Water is one of the most challenging and complex risks faced by cities and its residents. The impact of water challenges i.e floods, pollution, water scarcity combined with pressing urban challenges — i.e. rapid urbanisation, growing demand for services, migration pressures, and climate change — could result in catastrophic impacts. Yet the connecting and interdependent strength of water provides us with an opportunity that cannot be ignored — water can be used as leverage for impactful and catalytic change."
