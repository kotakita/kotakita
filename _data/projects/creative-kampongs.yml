  paragraph1: "Urban informal and home-based industries which operates out of many urban villages (kampongs) are often neglected and marginalized from planning processes. The intricate nature of the economy, challenges and opportunities are rarely understood and documented. Close observations reveal that the informal economy has become pivotal sector in the urban economy in general, despite its marginal acknowledgement. In the 1998 economic crisis impacted almost all formal sector enterprises in Surakarta. Many factory workers who were let go, turned to small-scale production jobs and informal trading for employment. These informal activities were not limited to the more common street traders/vendors (food and other goods) but also home-based craft production. The growth of this industry spread throughout the city and formed agglomerated industrial locales - kampung-based sentra or industrial clusters. The emergent economic phenomenon continue to grow, occupy and transform Indonesian cities."
  paragraph2: "Kota Kita, supported by the British Academy and University College London, launched a research project to further understand and document the informal economy of the urban kampong. Started from March 2016, the research aims to understand the prospects and challenges faced by micro-scale urban industries. It also explores the potentials of the industries by understanding the nature of inventiveness of the industries, and how they survive amid the expansive capitalist economy in the city."
