  paragraph1: "Karimunjawa is a cluster of 27 islands located in the north of Central Java with tremendous potential for sustainable tourism-based development, much like other island-based hotspots in Indonesia. With an attractive landscape and a nascent tourism market, there is an opportunity to develop a more cohesive, environmentally sustainable and culturally meaningful tourism industry that not only coexists, but actively participates in the landscapes’ potential. To achieve this, there is a need to understand its local context, existing characteristics, socio-economic activities, values, and — most importantly — the aspirations of the communities."
