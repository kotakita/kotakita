  paragraph1: "Land subsidence and sea-level rise are a severe problem for areas on the north coast of Central Java. Along the coastline of Semarang and Demak, land subsidence due to massive groundwater extraction and sea-level rise has been worsening the coastal flooding and coastal erosion, severely hampering economic development due to blocked transportation routes, loss of land for agriculture and aquaculture and costs for continuous repairs of public and private infrastructure and assets. This has also resulted in community displacement to other areas as they lost their jobs and land. A threshold may have been reached where coastal restoration and aquaculture revitalisation measures in Demak may no longer be feasible at the landscape scale unless subsidence is halted."
