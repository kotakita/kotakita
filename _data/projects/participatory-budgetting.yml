  paragraph1: "Communal gatherings and collective discussions are a common practice in Indonesian society, where community members frequently collaborate towards a shared goal. This deeply cultural practice, referred to as gotong-royong, is a method for building consensus around community issues. The musrenbang process allows citizens to express their priorities for development projects at the neighbourhood, district and city level. Other than voting for their political leaders every five years, musrenbang is a rare opportunity for many citizens to express their needs and desires for the communities in which they live. It has great potential, but it is often treated as a sort of non-binding wish list."
  paragraph2: "Musrenbang practice enables local government to better collaborate citizens and allowing discussion that accommodates community aspirations and priorities in a formal forum. It empowers citizens and strengthen the capacity of civil society organizations to contribute meaningfully to the development agenda and decision making processes. Finally, it promotes accountability and transparency in budget allocation and implementation for public welfare."
