            The Water as Leverage Program, organized by the Netherland Enterprise Agency (RVO.nl), aims to develop innovative, bankable and implementable design proposals to tackle water-related problems in three different cities in Asia: Semarang, Indonesia; Khulna, Bangladesh; and Chennai, India. The challenge is to match long-term comprehensive urban planning with short term innovative transformations; ambitious climate adaptation plans with bankable projects; the development of more knowledge on water systems with the construction of more resilient cities; research, design and implementation with inclusive urban alliances.

          <p>The program started at the end of 2018 and two design teams were assigned to work closely with the Semarang City
          Government to build the water-resilient strategies for the Central Java capital city: One Resilient and Cascading
          Semarang Team. Kota Kita acts as a Local Lead in the One Resilient consortium, which includes international
          multidisciplinary organizations such as One Architecture and Urbanism as Team leads, Deltares, Wetlands International,

          <p>During the nine months of the Water as Leverage Program, the two design teams developed five strategic programs from upland to coast that tackle pressing water-problem in Semarang including water supply, land subsidence, flooding, and sea-level rise, under one comprehensive and holistic approach. These five programmatic ideas have been presented at the International Seminar hosted by the Mayor of Semarang on March 13th, 2019, alongside a regional audience. In April 2019, the Water as Leverage Program concluded the Phase 2 with a regional workshop in Singapore attended by international financing institutions (IFIs) such as World Bank, ADB, Green Climate Fund (GCF) along with partners and advisory boards 100RC, PfR and OECD.</p>
