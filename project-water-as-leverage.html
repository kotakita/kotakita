          <p>The Water as Leverage Program, organized by the Netherland Enterprise Agency (RVO.nl), aims to develop innovative,
          bankable and implementable design proposals to tackle water-related problems in three different cities in Asia:
          Semarang, Indonesia; Khulna, Bangladesh; and Chennai, India. The challenge is to match long-term comprehensive urban
          planning with short term innovative transformations; ambitious climate adaptation plans with bankable projects; the
          development of more knowledge on water systems with the construction of more resilient cities; research, design and
          implementation with inclusive urban alliances.</p>

          <!-- <p>The pilot project for Women on Wheels in Indonesia implemented different tools to promote female cycling in Solo. Kota Kita, in partnership with Living Cities , researchers, and the Solo City local government, bicycle groups, and citizens, executed a series of strategic activities that responded to the conditions of our four chosen target groups: schoolgirls, women and women workers, DOTs, and civil society groups. Pro-cycling and awareness raising activities are structured to address the issues of infrastructure and safety, bicycle design and norms and attitudes.</p> -->

Current and future initiatives include a series of  public campaigns and bike clinics to improve cyclistsâ€™ capacity and readiness on the road,  integrated bicycle map for tourism, leisure, and safe routes information, and advocacy for inclusion of pro-cycling agenda and initiatives into city budget (APBD or Anggaran Pendapatan dan Belanja Daerah).</p>

          <p>The program started at the end of 2018 and two design teams were assigned to work closely with the Semarang City
          Government to build the water-resilient strategies for the Central Java capital city: One Resilient and Cascading
          Semarang Team. Kota Kita acts as a Local Lead in the One Resilient consortium, which includes international
          multidisciplinary organizations such as One Architecture and Urbanism as Team leads, Deltares, Wetlands International,

          <p>During the nine months of the Water as Leverage Program, the two design teams developed five strategic programs from upland to coast that tackle pressing water-problem in Semarang including water supply, land subsidence, flooding, and sea-level rise, under one comprehensive and holistic approach. These five programmatic ideas have been presented at the International Seminar hosted by the Mayor of Semarang on March 13th, 2019, alongside a regional audience. In April 2019, the Water as Leverage Program concluded the Phase 2 with a regional workshop in Singapore attended by international financing institutions (IFIs) such as World Bank, ADB, Green Climate Fund (GCF) along with partners and advisory boards 100RC, PfR and OECD.</p>
