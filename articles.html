            <h2>Indonesian cities are being developed at a rapid pace, yet the communities most affected by the shopping malls, resorts and commercial building that are sprouting are having little say in how their environment should be shaped. There is growing alarm of the environmental and social consequences of development that is exclusive of communities, leaving investors as the sole winner, undermining the promise of benefits for the local communities.</h2>

            <h3>Bali: An Island Paradise at Threat</h3>
            <p>Luxury hotels, rollercoaster rides and a Formula One circuit on a tropical island—it might sound like paradise to some, but for the communities on Indonesia’s Bali island, it’s an environmental disaster waiting to happen.</p>
            <hr class="featurette-divider">

            <p>Indonesian developer Tirta Wahana Bali Internasional is planning to reclaim 833 hectares of land to build such a resort in Benoa Bay, part of the world-famous Nusa Dua resort.</p>
            <p>But civil society group ForBALI says the $2.5 billion project will dramatically change the character of southern Bali and lead to sea level rises, inundating low-lying villages nearby, a claim backed by a <a href="www.thebalidaily.com/2013-08-02/benoa-bay-reclamation-could-have-grave-impact.html" target="_blank">Conservation International</a> audit of the plan.</p>
            <p>It will also destroy 700 hectares of once-protected mangrove wetlands, a type of underwater forest rich in biodiversity and carbon, which is emitted into the atmosphere when destroyed, contributing to climate change. These changes come with social impacts, as the project clashes with the local culture and tranquility that draws millions to the island each year.</p>

            <hr class="featurette-divider">
            <p>ForBALI has fought the proposed project since 2013, bringing together citizen activists, academics, politicians, local leaders, artists and musicians under the campaign <i>Tolak Reklamasi</i> (Reject the Reclamation), demanding the plan be scrapped.</p>
            <p>It has used regular public protests, concerts, cultural events and social media to reach the public and communities affected by the proposed development, in what is possibly Indonesia’s most active citizen-driven movements in local governance. </p>
            <p>It started out with 25 supporters and now has 7,000 from around Indonesia, also gaining the attention of international environmental groups.</p>
            <blockquote><p>“The movement is a test of the democratic process in Indonesia, as well as an exercise in citizen participation,” ForBALI coordinator Wayan “Gendo” Suardana told Kota Kita.</p></blockquote>
            <blockquote><p>“<i>Tolak Reklamasi</i> aims to shows the potential environmental and social damage of land reclamation, but also the importance of civic responsibility to participate in the urban governance and challenge the opaque decision-making processes that are going on,” Suardana said.</p></blockquote>
            <blockquote><p>“Kota Kita supports ForBALI’s efforts to mobilize citizens, raise awareness about environmental issues in Bali, and advocate for a more democratic approach to development. We look forward to working with and promoting efforts like these; our future is within the hands of people who are willing to stand up, voice their opinions, and promote a sustainable and just Indonesia.” Ahmad Rifai, Director of Kota Kita said.</p></blockquote>
            <p>Bali attracts up to <a href="www.disparda.baliprov.go.id/en/Statistics2" target="_blank">10 million international and domestic tourists each year</a> and concern is growing that it is becoming overcrowded — both for tourists and local communities. ForBALI says the last thing the island needs is more hotels.</p>
            <p>In the popular south of the Island, hotel rooms rose from 22,000 in 2011 to almost 55,000 in 2014. There are believed to be thousand more unregistered room.</p>
            <p>Nonetheless, at least 67 hotels are approved for building in 2016.</p>
            <p>This is despite the fact there is a moratorium issued in 2011 by the Bali Governor Made Mangku on development in place. It was issued <a href="www.thebalidaily.com/2014-01-29/bali-fails-implement-hotel-moratorium.html" target="_blank">to regulate new hotel development in southern Bali</a>, but is often ignored by the regency officials who issue building permits in pursuit of higher revenues, often in greenbelt areas where development is banned.</p>
            <p>The Benoa Bay plan was made possible in 2014 when the president issued a resolution that changed the bay’s protected greenbelt status to a zone for “revitalization”, a word activists say is a euphemism for development.</p>
            <p>Despite the widespread support for <i>Tolak Reklamasi</i> Suardana says “our collective work is not over”, adding he won’t give up until the project is shelved.</p>

            <h3>Makassar: Indonesia’s Projected City of Tomorrow?</h3>
            <p>As the bustling Indonesian capital Jakarta is stretched to its limits, with choking traffic, overdevelopment and aging infrastructure, the country plans to make the city of Makassar its second power hub.</p>
            <p>Situated on the southeastern coat of Sulawesi Island, right in the centre of the sprawling Indonesian archipelago, Makassar is already a bustling centre for trade, business, industry and new developments, and is seen as a gateway to the nation’s developing east.</p>
            <p>It has already built an international airport, toll roads and an integrated business complex in recent years, and now there are plans to increase the city size by 20 percent, in a land reclamation megaproject that will exacerbate climate change impacts already hitting communities hard.</p>
            <p>But a Kota Kita study found that these rapid developments are only going to exacerbate the impact that climate change is already having on communities, and warned that the poorest communities would be most profoundly affected.</p>
            <p>Traditional fishing communities in Makassar are at the frontline of climate change, as sea levels are expected to rise, threatening inundation of these communities’ villages and severely damage to the marine ecosystems, reducing the fish stocks they rely on for a livelihood.</p>
            <p>The study focused on the level of vulnerability of these communities, measuring and mapping by neighborhood the susceptibility to climate change impacts, assessing the capacity of a range of governmental, civil society and community bodies dealing with climate hazards.</p>
            <p>It also looked at how communities are adapting to changes to ecosystems they rely on, focusing on watersheds and wetlands, which play an essential role in minimizing sensitivity to climate change impacts for poor and vulnerable communities.</p>
            <p>Land reclamation projects only worsen these problems, the study found — they involve taking land from the periphery and dumping it in the sea to create landfill, in many cases pushing the sea level up further.</p>
            <p>Developments along Makassar’s coastal wetlands also threaten to block some communities’ access to the ocean and to force people out from their homes as eviction of poor communities in Indonesia is common, in the case of major developments.</p>
            <p>Local communities say there is disconnect between their needs and the development plans. In the past, when fishing communities have been evicted to make way for development projects, <a href="http://makassar.tribunnews.com/2015/06/18/sjpm-tolak-reklamasi-pantai-makassar" target="_blank">they have not been offered roles in the city’s rapid transformation</a>. They are forced into informal sectors where income is tenuous and not necessarily sustainable.  The assessment expresses concern that this trend could lead to larger social problems, including limited job opportunities and poverty.</p>
            <p>“As development projects go forward and cities are rapidly urbanized in Indonesia, most of the time no process of public consultation has taken place at all, so the vulnerability of poor communities grows immensely,” Kota Kita Executive Director Ahmad Rifai said.</p>
            <p>“Makassar’s city leadership must articulate a coherent vision for the city that promotes resilience and pro-poor development. Such a vision can facilitate better coordination between city departments and city stakeholders, including its citizens,” he said.</p>
            <p>The first stage of land reclamation project — CitraLand City Losari Makassar — will be developed in 2018 on 107 hectares of reclaimed land, part of a larger, 1,000-hectare integrated business district called Center Point of Indonesia (CPI).  CitraLand City Makassar is designed as Makassar’s “new town”, with modern facilities, housing and commercial areas, including office buildings, hotels and shopping malls.</p>
            <p>Makassar’s development projects have seen resistance from the civil society groups, especially with the main concerns that the poor communities would remain on the losing side of development.</p>
            <p>In a protest against the land reclamation project in Makassar, Aswar Exwar, chairman of Wahana Lingkungan Hidup (WALHI) South Sulawesi, an independent environmental civil society group, said that that Makassar’s natural ecosystems have been seriously damaged.</p>
            <p>“In some instances land reclamation can serve to protect against abrasion and erosion, particularly for islands and damaged coastal areas. Reclamation should help to rejuvenate coastal areas, what we have seen is another way, a lot of damage within mangrove conservation areas, coral reefs, and other organisms in coastal areas,” Exwar said.</p>

            <h5 class="text-uppercase">Feature by <strong>Jeremy Gross</strong></h5>
            <h6>August 4th, 2015</h6>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-9">
            <h2>If you hear Mongolian on the streets of Solo these days, you might wonder what it is exactly that’s bringing these visitors to the central Indonesian city. It’s not the world-famous textile <i>batik</i>, but something far more surprising: technical knowledge.</h2>
            <hr class="featurette-divider">
            <p>Mongolia’s economic boom, coupled with harsh winters that have killed off cattle and traditional livelihoods, have made the country’s rural, pastoralist lifestyle less attractive and economically viable. As rural residents flood to the capital, Ulaanbaatar, in search of work, city residents now account for one-half of Mongolia’s total population, up from one-quarter only 25 years ago.</p>
            <p>There was an urgent need for officials in Mongolia’s capital to better understand how these new residents were living so that they could provide them with the basic services they need.</p>
            <p>So in March 2013, a Mongolian delegation visited Solo in Central Java to learn from an innovative community mapping initiative, pioneered in 2009 by Solo-based NGO Kota Kita. For the first time, the mapping project enabled citizens to interact in participatory planning, budgeting, and urban development decisions in this city of over 500,000.</p>
            <hr class="featurette-divider">

            <hr class="featurette-divider">
            <p>The focus was on the city’s ger districts that surround the capital. Sixty percent of the population live in these areas in gers, also know as yurts, which are the traditional, portable round houses made of felt found throughout Central Asia.</p>
            <p>These communities live without access to basic services such as electricity and water. Given this rapid growth, the government has not been able to develop adequate planning for the soaring ger developments. However, potential solutions have come in from unlikely places – most recently from Solo, Indonesia.</p>
            <p>Although the two cities appear to be very different, Solo and Ulaanbaatar share similarities, including rapid population growth. In both places, governance has traditionally been top-down, and collecting accurate social and welfare data has historically not been a priority. Both cities also share similarities in their local administrative structure – Indonesia has a RT (neighborhood association) system that is based on 30-50 households that act as community leaders at the lowest level in the administrative system. </p>
            <p>Ulaanbaatar has khoroos, under which there are community leaders similar to RT leaders who are involved in decision-making at the local level. Both local governments have recognized the need to gather data at the local level, and traditional methods of data collection have proven unreliable and lacking in the detail and nuance needed to accurately reflect local needs. These local administrative structures prove ideal for community-based problem solving through the generation of crowd-sourced information.</p>
            <hr class="featurette-divider">
            <img class="featurette-image img-responsive" src="./src/img/feature/mongolia-planning/banner3.jpg">
            <hr class="featurette-divider">
            <p>An advantage of this bottom-up community mapping approach is that it is able to generate a high degree of accuracy about the location of specific infrastructure facilities, which can be identified on city maps. Previously, information was not available at the lowest levels, so nuances around pockets of poverty and lack of services could not be identified.</p>
            <p>Important to both cities is the need to identify community solutions that stem from a lack of government capacity, and the need for citizens and community organizations to engage in discussions to find effective mechanisms for infrastructure maintenance. The information generated for the maps helps bring people together to discuss how best to share their resources.</p>
            <p>This was the basis of the community mapping database project in Solo. The maps and “mini atlases” available on the website, Solo Kota Kita, profile information about every neighborhood in Solo. The data collected are linked to the local budget process (musrembang), which informs a series of maps that show services such as the provision of schools and health clinics graphically. </p>
            <p>These tools are used to understand the urban issues facing residents related to education, poverty, and health, and have helped the local government prioritize spending and development priorities as patterns emerge in the incidence and correlation of deprivation and social problems.</p>
            <p>Bima, a junior planner at Kota Kita, had no idea that the work he started in Solo would be of interest to people in other countries. “I thought every city had a different system, set of policies and geography. I had no idea our ideas could be implemented in other countries,” he said.</p>
            <blockquote><p>“But then I came to realize that urban data and information that is easy to read and understand is very important for all citizens. Better information creates a better future for a city. If the community can understand their neighborhood and its conditions through maps and data, it will help in planning and prioritizing.”</p></blockquote>
            <p>Solo’s mapping tool as a way of dealing with urban planning problems has been particularly useful for Ulaanbaatar’s ger districts. Following the study tour in 2013, the City Municipality requested a similar mapping project for the ger districts. After an intensive data collection and mapping process in 87 neighborhoods, the Manaikhoroo Community Mapping website launched in January 2014, with information on 11 indicators concerning accessibility and availability of public services, including street lighting, illegal garbage dumping, and crime hotspots, via downloadable maps.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gerelchuluun, head of the city’s Governor’s Office, said that this more transparent approach has allowed the city to more effectively monitor and evaluate the performance of city officials in providing services and making improvements. The city is now introducing a plan by which the best performing local district head will receive a bonus equivalent to one year of their salary.</p>
            <p>By focusing on local service provision and facilities, elected officials are held accountable in a way that elections do not provide for, so the system also supports more informed political decision-making. In Ulaanbaatar, the mapping project has enabled the mayor to engage citizens in community meetings in all 87 ger areas, with over 300,000 people participating in city budget discussions.</p>
            <p>In February 2014, a second delegation from Mongolia, this time including representatives of the Ulaanbaatar’s District Governments and the City Municipality, visited Solo to learn more about participatory budgeting and planning policies, how urban redevelopment and planning processes can spur economic development, and how community savings schemes such as revolving funds can support community-level development and employment. If applied in Ulaanbaatar, these could make an important contribution to the lives of some of its most vulnerable residents living in the ger districts.</p>

            <h2>Indonesia is the world’s biggest archipelago with an abundance of rivers, lakes and springs, yet getting clean water to all 250 million people in the country is an enormous challenge.</h2>
            <hr class="featurette-divider">
            <p>Technically, Indonesia has enough natural renewable water for each person to use 22,000 liters a day. But a lack of infrastructure, water pollution, climate change and leaky pipes are some of the reasons so many Indonesians do not have access to clean water at all.</p>
            <p>Only 20 percent of the population has a household water connection, while 85 percent has access to clean drinking water sources that don’t come out of a bottle, according to Stratfor Global Intelligence. That means some 37 million are left their own devices to find clean water for their daily needs.</p>
            <p>In developed urban areas, clean drinking water resources are near impossible to find, leaving tens of millions of people depending on bottled water, which is delivered on trucks that choke already congested roads. Even in rural parts, clean drinking water is becoming scarcer as rivers and lakes are increasingly polluted in line with development.</p>
            <p>Kota Kita has teamed up with researchers from the Institute of Water Policy at the National University of Singapore to work out just how connected residents of Indonesia’s Solo city are to water resources and what initiatives they have taken themselves to manage the resource in their communities.</p>
            <blockquote><p>“We hope that by understanding community-based water management better in Solo we can help find alternative approaches and solutions for better water delivery, particularly for the poor where there is still great need,” said Kota Kita executive director Ahmad Rifai.</p></blockquote>
            <p>The Solo river basin is among the world’s 15 most stressed, according to the World Resources Institute, and rapid urbanization has led to major growth in the city’s fringe areas, leading to a surge in water demand and putting strain on the Cokro Tulung mountain spring, the city’s main source.</p>
            <p>Rita Padawangi from the Institute of Water Policy recently spent time in Solo kampungs, including slum areas, with Kota Kita to work out the exact water access problems and the communities’ needs. The next step in the research will involve more in-depth surveys to try and identify the most appropriate solutions.</p>
            <p>In the Solo village of Mojosongo, for example, the community has had a deep well for more than five years, built by the government. They have managed it by themselves, setting tariffs for the community and taking turns to lead the management team.</p>
            <blockquote><p>“But the iron pipes are already starting to rust — newer deep well systems don’t use iron, they use new synthetic rust proof materials, so this needs replacing, which is something we think should be voiced to the government,” Rita said following her visit to Solo in January.</p></blockquote>
            <p>In another slum area, Semanggi, one neighborhood of 350 households was able to build its own communal water facility and a communal toilet. While Rita thinks the government must take more responsibility in building water facilities, the example shows how community involvement can improve conditions.</p>
            <blockquote><p>“Most homes here don’t have toilets, so they also built a communal toilet for people to use and an area for them to shower in. The facility they built is a public tap from a deep well. There is another tap provided by the public water utility company, which is more expensive, but people go there to buy water from both taps,” she said.</p></blockquote>
            <h3>USAID has funded a second toilet in the community after hearing of the project’s success.</h3>
            <hr class="featurette-divider">
            <h2>A river runs red</h2>
            <p>Educational campaigns are also needed to change the culture of dumping pollutants in rivers, Rita said. As industry booms in Indonesia, dumping is destroying what was once a main resource of surface water across the country.</p>
            <p>Seventy-five percent of Indonesia’s rivers are classified as heavily polluted, according to the environment ministry. In the Solo village of Laweyan, famous for making the traditional hand-dyed batik cloth, Rita saw batik makers dumping red dye into the river.</p>
            <blockquote><p>“We saw this on a random day just passing by, so this must happen a lot. And this is despite the fact that there is a facility to process the waste just across the river, accessible via a small bridge. This means more needs to be done to educate communities about the effects of dumping,” Rita said.</p></blockquote>
            <p>This also affects the quality of ground water, which millions rely on through home-made pumps. In Laweyan, the unregulated dumping of pollutants in the river and drainage system has affected the quality of groundwater too. Because riverbanks are porous, the pollutants get into the underground sources.</p>
            <blockquote><p>“A plan to start separating sewage pipes and drainage is badly needed to save rivers as an existing source of water,” Rifai said.</p></blockquote>
            <p>In the neighboring village of Sondakan, the community complains that the quality of the groundwater they once  drank started to change around 15 years ago and has been determined as undrinkable by lab tests.</p>
            <p>This is not unique to Solo — 74 percent of households in Indonesia’s urban areas rely on groundwater. Overuse is increasing water salinity in places like the capital, Jakarta, and is also a major cause of land subsidence. East Jakarta, for example, is sinking by some 13 inches a year.</p>
            <p>Some 40 percent of useable water in Indonesia is lost through leaky pipes and illegal access to water, according to the Jakarta Water Supply Regulation Body. Many who illegally tap into water systems do so because they simply have no other way to access water.</p>
            <blockquote><p>“The problem is clearly not that our cities lack water, but poor distribution and poor infrastructure makes it very difficult to access water in particular areas, especially in dense poor areas where there are no taps because of a lack of planning. Better collaboration between governments and communities is key to opening up this planning process,” Rifai said.</p></blockquote>

            <h2>Indonesia’s parliament has voted unanimously to let the people elect their own local leaders after months of political maneuvering that had threatened to quell a new wave of participatory governance, but observers are cautious that undemocratic changes may yet be made to the electoral system.</h2>
            <hr class="featurette-divider">
            <p>A new generation of directly elected progressive local leaders are helping millions of Indonesians enjoy better lifestyles by including residents in the management of their cities, but their future was put at risk in September last year after the previous parliament in its final days voted to scrap local elections, leaving regional parliaments to appoint governors, mayors and district chiefs.</p>
            <p>Even though the opposition coalition of parties, which has a majority of seats in parliament, spearheaded the move to scrap local direct elections, they all voted in favor of keeping local elections on January 20, reversing the law passed in September.</p>
            <p>Kota Kita welcomed the parliament’s decision to let people choose their own leaders, describing direct elections as the people’s right.</p>
            <blockquote><p>“Indonesia has dodged a bullet — if local leaders were chosen by parliaments, this would just hand power to political parties, which are traditionally much further removed from the people, are conservative and less creative,” Kota Kita co-founder and director John Taylor said.</p></blockquote>
            <p>Direct elections are the very mechanism that allowed Indonesia to shift from a decades-long autocratic government to a more democratic and socially just one, Taylor said, adding that they had allowed the emergence of leaders who are proving to be open to new ideas and more creative about solving complex urban problems.</p>
            <blockquote><p>“But we should remain cautious as the parliament is poised to make revisions to local elections. All Indonesians and relevant organizations should keep monitoring to ensure any revisions are democratic, so this new generation of leaders can continue their good work,” Taylor said.</p></blockquote>
            <p>Local leaders taking a bottom-up approach to urban management have sprouted following the meteoric rise of President Joko Widodo, a man with humble beginnings who was elected Solo city mayor and became wildly popular for his frequent visits to villages to hear communities’ grievances and for cutting red tape to find quick solutions to urban problems.</p>
            <p>Known affectionately as Jokowi, the mayor moved up to become governor of the capital, Jakarta, where he won legions of fans before rising to the presidency in the July 2014 poll.</p>
            <p>His political opponents had argued that scrapping local elections would reduce costs as the country carries out hundreds of polls each year, but the law’s passage in September was more widely seen as revenge against the president, and a way to prevent reform-minded leaders from being elected by the people and rising up the ranks again.</p>
            <p>Under immense political pressure, then-President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono overturned the bill before Joko’s inauguration through a decree, after his Democratic Party stormed out of the September vote, essentially handing victory to the opposition in having local  elections scrapped.</p>
            <h3>But the party made an about-face on January 20, voting to keep the elections.</h3>

            <h2>Overhauling cities</h2>
            <p>In the meantime, mayors in the cities of Surabaya and Bandung have made enormous changes to improve city life with the help of citizens.</p>
            <p>Surabaya Mayor Tri Rismaharini was nominated for the World Mayor award in 2014 for her overhaul of the country’s second-biggest city, having made simple changes to transform what was once an eyesore of industrial activity to a clean living space adorned with parks — a rarity in Indonesian cities.</p>
            <p>Under her leadership, simple changes to Surabaya’s drainage system has dramatically reduced flooding. Listening to the people, Tri fought off an earlier government plan to build a toll road through the already congested city, instead drawing up plans for a monorail and tram system. </p>
            <p>The “one soul, one tree” campaign saw 5,000 new trees planted to restore mangrove forests along the beaches, where poor communities have received training to produce goods, such as mangrove batik, syrup and other food products. The city government has also begun and urban farming program.</p>
            <p>The story is similar in Bandung, Indonesia’s third-biggest city. Bandung mayor Ridwan Kamil, perhaps the country’s best-known architect, has mapped out a city of cable cars, monorails, bike sharing lanes and even a pedestrian skywalk in a country where footpaths are usually unusable because of damage and poor management.</p>
            <p>Ridwan was one of the most vocal opponents to the law scrapping local elections, and as an avid Twitter user, he instructed all departments in his administration to set up Twitter accounts so that the public could report problems, such as damaged roads and blocked drains, by posting photos.</p>
            <blockquote><p>“I’m using collaborative energy to transform urbanism. Collaboration is (part) of our culture. During the floods in February 2005, we asked citizens to dig boreholes, one-meter deep with a diameter of 10 centimeters to absorb the rainwater. In one week, we had 10,000 volunteers digging 3,050 holes — a world record,” Ridwan told green architecture journal FutureArc.</p></blockquote>
            <p>Civil servants too are finding inspiration from these leaders, bringing participatory governance to their departments.</p>
            <p>Fajar Desira, the Regional Planning and Development Agency chief of Banjarmasin city on Borneo island, worked with students, residents of a the Sungai Jingah riverbank village and Kota Kita on the Firm Foundation project to restore a port that had fallen into disrepair.</p>
            <p>The design helped revive important daily economic activities, such as purchasing vegetables from boat vendors, and the public space included multiple ways to engage the river through fishing and other activities.</p>
            <p>“Pak Fajar selected the site, contacted the village chiefs and helped us coordinate with all the officials at the neighborhood government office and agencies we needed. He essentially facilitated our direct engagement with the local population and gave his official approval of our work, which is very important in Indonesia,” Taylor said.</p>
            <blockquote><p>“It’s heartening to see so many leaders taking this inclusive approach. We commend the parliament for supporting these innovative leaders and urge them to protect democracy in its local election revisions.”</p></blockquote>
