				<h2>Solo Kota Kita</h2>
				<h5>www.solokotakita.org</h5>
				<p>SoloKotaKita.org is Kota Kita’s first web app; it makes available up-to-date, fine grain information about the city of Solo in order to support the city’s participatory budgeting cycle, the Musrenbang. Selecting different layers of information, different neighborhoods, and different years allows citizens to research the needs of their communities. This information can be discussed with other citizens in order to prioritize infrastructure projects, compare one neighborhood with another, and advocate for specific services or needs using data.</p>

				<h2>Mini Atlases</h2>
				<p>Mini Atlases are neighborhood profiles created for each of the city’s Kelurahans (neighborhoods). They present basic socio-economic and demographic information together with maps of the neighborhoods in a legible and easy-to-use format. The maps can be used by residents to support discussions about assets and issues within their neighborhoods.</p>

After the earthquake, a Community Action Planning process took place in Purus where residents discussed the priority issues that needed to be addressed by small infrastructure investments. The poster serves as a reminder of this workshop and the collective decisions taken to re-build after the disaster; it can be used as an advocacy tool to engage in planning efforts with local government.</p>

				<h2>Participatory infrastructure monitoring</h2>
				<p>The participatory infrastructure monitoring app is a digital tool that promotes transparency and accountability. It tracks the progress of neighborhood-level infrastructure projects identified and prioritized during the city’s local budgeting process, the Musrenbang. By demonstrating what projects were selected, the budget amount, the year they were approved, and their status, the web app makes it possible for citizens to check on the status of projects that they selected. The web app contains project information for all of the city’s neighborhood-level infrastructure projects over the last three years.</p>

				<h2>Manual for Gender-Responsive Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment</h2>
				<p>The Manual provides social leaders, NGOs, universities, community-based organizations or local governments with a tool to help undertake a gender-responsive climate change vulnerability assessment in their city. The Manual provides both a set of practical tools to assess vulnerability – such as a methodology about how to collect and analyze data, conduct workshops, and work with stakeholders – as well as offers educational material to educate readers about the impacts of climate change and urbanization on women.</p>
				<p>The Manual draws from climate change vulnerability assessments conducted in the cities of Kupang, Makassar and Manado to provide context and provide examples about how gender-sensitive issues related to climate impacts can be better evaluated and understood – leading to better adaption planning and gender-responsive policymaking.</p>

				<h2>Musrenbang Tracker</h2>
				<p>The Musrenbang Tracker (or Mus-Tracker for short) is an online application that provides residents of Solo greater access to information about the selection and implementation of small-scale infrastructure projects in their neighborhoods. The web- tool links a citywide database to a web browser that can be accessed by anyone with Internet, for example through his or her Smart phone or laptop. Residents can track individual projects that they voted on and monitor their status, as well as make comments about these projects. As a result the public is able to actively participate in monitoring and overseeing the implementation of projects. The Mus-Tracker offers a younger, more tech-savvy population the opportunity to become involved in neighborhood development.</p>
				<p>The Mus-Tracker can be found at <a href="https://www.solokotakita.org/musrenbangtracker/">www.solokotakita.org/musrenbangtracker</a></p>

				<h2>Manual for Urban Climate Risk Management</h2>
				<p>This Manual is designed to support local governments, NGOs, consultants and universities to create an Urban Climate Risk Management Plan. The Manual offers a guide for a participatory process of resilience planning; this process includes translating recommendations from a Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment into a set of prioritized actions, through discussion, analysis and eventually the creation of an official planning document.</p>
				<p>One of the key features of the Manual is guidance about how to create a city working group who’s role it is to monitor and evaluate the action plan, and ensure its effective implementation. The Manual draws on a similar process conducted in the City of Makassar, providing examples and identifying issues encountered from that city.</p>
