          <p>The project aims to improve these conditions by formulating gender sensitive and context based solutions. In many households, women are least privileged to use the motorcycle for mobility, turning to alternative options such as walking or cycling. The implementation of tools for the promotion and championing of cycling is crucial for the improvement of their quality of life and access to social and economic activities. The bicycle is not only a mode for sustainable mobilization, but also a tool for gender equality and independence.</p>

          <p>The pilot project for Women on Wheels in Indonesia implemented different tools to promote female cycling in Solo. Kota Kita, in partnership with Living Cities , researchers, and the Solo City local government, bicycle groups, and citizens, executed a series of strategic activities that responded to the conditions of our four chosen target groups: schoolgirls, women and women workers, DOTs, and civil society groups. Pro-cycling and awareness raising activities are structured to address the issues of infrastructure and safety, bicycle design and norms and attitudes.</p>

Since 2017, Kota Kita has been working  with Solo City Department of Transportation on a number of activities. A bicycle safety workshop and bike clinic where the Kota Kita team and DoT officials share safe riding protocols and practical tips to overcome challenges with bike maintenance . It invited representatives of women groups from all 51 neighborhoods in Solo. As a follow-up , Kota Kita held a safe riding competition for women groups which garnered more than 150 participants.</p>

          <h3>Bike Maps</h3>
          <p>Solo has the opportunity to improve its tourism potential by accommodating robust cycling infrastructure in the city. Kota Kita created a bike map that integrates urban tourism information and safe bike routes derived from context-based research and technical road analysis. The routes are thematically categorized into heritage, craft, and city park. The team conducted consultations with different stakeholders, include  citizens, government agencies, and  tourism board to iterate for optimal functionality. The <a href='http://bit.ly/solomap'>map</a> will be an information tool for locals and visitors that are looking for safer cycling route alternatives to enjoy the city.</p>
